NETDIVE TAKES PRICE BACK

14. July 2001, San Francisco, CA. NetDIVE (www.netdive.com) surprised
developers this week by stating that no prizes will be awarded in their 20'000
USD contest, after having announced and notified the winner the day before.

One month after the official notification date, Netdive broke its silence
about the result of their CMC International Java Contest. The winners should 
have been announced on June 6th at Java One.

"I hope submissions were no serious work with commercial potential", says one
developer, pointing out that the contest rules stated "that Netdive would hold 
ownership of all entries to quite some extent".

"The lack of reply from NetDive was, for me, enough to notice the lack of
seriousness of the contest" he says, and is lucky that he did not decide to
submit his work. Other developers have tried over a month to get information 
about their submission without success.

Only after developers announced they would tell the press, Netdive stated that
"one entry will be awarded the 3rd place prize". However, the next day the
company took their prize back and said they "have found it necessary to 
terminate the entire contest".

Now developers world-wide feel that "Netdive's misbehaviour is a provocation
and their explanations are arrogant and insulting" and hope the Internet 
community will spread this message around the globe to "prevent further waste 
of time for Netdive and the like".

Netdive, who claims to be a market leading developer changed the contest
website several times behind the scenes. Copies of the different versions
